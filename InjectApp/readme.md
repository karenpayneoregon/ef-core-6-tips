# About

*ASP.NET Core makes it very easy to configure and use Entity Framework Core in web applications. For .NET Core console applications there is no such machinery available but we can still use Entity Framework Core in console applications.*

[Gunnar Peipman](https://gunnarpeipman.com/bio/)

I took [code](https://gunnarpeipman.com/ef-core-console-application/) from Gunnar and adapted his code to Book/Category models to show how to use dependency injection in a Console project. For the connection string I added the same code used in all the other projects in this repostory rather than Gunnar's.


# What is learned

- How to use Dependency Injection in a Console project
- That a developer can find code on the web, study the code, decide if it is appropriate than adapt to their project

# What not to do

Take code from the web, copy-n-paste and when it does not work go ask why in a forum without first making attempts to figure out why yourself. When copy-n-paste always take time to understand the code rather than just using the code.
